# Eco-Concrete Strength Predictor

***

## Project Overview

This project predicts the compressive strength of eco-friendly concrete mixes using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to enable quick, sustainable, and practical strength estimation without destructive lab testing.

***

## Features

- Complete data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling, and splitting
- Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for regression
- Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and CatBoost
- Built-in evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² score, A20 index
- Simple visualizations included in code

***

## Input and Output

**Inputs:**  
- Cement  
- Water or Seawater  
- Fine Aggregates  
- Coarse Aggregates  
- Fly Ash  
- Blast-Furnace Slag  
- Superplasticizer  
- Concrete Age (days)  

**Output:**  
- Compressive Strength (MPa)

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for step-by-step model training and evaluation

***

## Dataset Overview

- 768 samples of concrete mixes
- Each sample includes all input features and measured strength

## Model Performance Example

| Model    | R² Score | MAE (MPa) | A20 Index |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| DNN      |   0.84   |    2.8    |   0.82    |
| XGBoost  |   0.87   |    2.5    |   0.79    |
| CatBoost |   0.88   |    2.4    |   0.81    |
