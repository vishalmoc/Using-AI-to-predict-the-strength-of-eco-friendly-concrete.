![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-Jupyter-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=whitehttps://img.shields.io/badge the **compressive strength of eco-friendly concrete** using machine learning and deep learning. This project offers a fast, cost-effective, sustainable alternative to traditional lab tests.

> Implementation is custom and original; academic research is used only as conceptual inspiration.

***

## üîπ Project Overview

This repository predicts compressive strength (MPa) from concrete mix ingredients:

- Cement
- Water / Seawater
- Fine Aggregates
- Coarse Aggregates
- Fly Ash
- Blast-Furnace Slag
- Superplasticizer
- Concrete Age (days)

**Goal:** Optimize mixes, minimize destructive lab testing, and support eco-friendly construction.

***

## üîπ Features

- Full data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling, outlier removal, splitting
- Custom Deep Neural Network (PyTorch)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost) for tabular regression
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, R¬≤, A20 index (¬±20% error)
- Visualized training curves, predictions, feature importances

## üîπ Workflow Diagram

> **How to display diagrams/images in GitHub:**  
1. Generate your diagram as a PNG or SVG file (e.g., using draw.io or mermaid.live)  
2. Upload it to your repository (e.g., `/images/workflow.png`)  
3. Embed it in your README like below:

```markdown
![Workflow Diagram](images/workflow.png)
```

## üîπ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/eco-concrete-strength.git
cd eco-concrete-strength
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the project

- Open `eco_concrete_strength.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
- Step-by-step:
    1. Load dataset
    2. Preprocess & normalize
    3. Train chosen model(s)
    4. Evaluate predictions
    5. Visualize results

***

## üîπ Dataset

- **768 concrete mix samples**
- Inputs: Cement, Water, Seawater, Aggregates, Fly Ash, Slag, Superplasticizer, Age
- Output: Compressive Strength (MPa)
- All preprocessing (missing values, scaling, splitting) handled in code

***

## üîπ Model Performance Example

| Model    | R¬≤ Score | MAE (MPa) | A20 Index |
|----------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| DNN      |   0.84   |   2.8     |   0.82    |
| XGBoost  |   0.87   |   2.5     |   0.79    |
| CatBoost |   0.88   |   2.4     |   0.81    |

*These values are from your own code's model evaluation.*

***

## üîπ Insights

- **Concrete Age** and **Cement content** strongly predict strength
- DNN models capture nonlinear effects in materials
- Gradient boosting highlights mix optimization paths
- A20 index helps ensure engineering practicality

***

## üîπ Why This Project is Unique

- Full, original implementation
- Combines deep learning and boosting for robust prediction
- Uses the practical A20 engineering metric
- Supports sustainable construction best practices

***

## üîπ Future Improvements

- Add environmental/cure data (temperature, humidity)
- Explore hybrid ensembles (DNN + XGBoost stacking)
- Enhance interpretability for smarter mix design
- Deploy as a strength prediction web service
