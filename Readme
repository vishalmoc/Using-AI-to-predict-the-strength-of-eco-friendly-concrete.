## 🔹 Project Overview

This repository predicts the compressive strength (MPa) of concrete mixes from key input features:

- Cement
- Water / Seawater
- Fine Aggregates
- Coarse Aggregates
- Fly Ash
- Blast-Furnace Slag
- Superplasticizer
- Concrete Age (days)

**Objective:** Enable data-driven optimization of mix design while reducing reliance on destructive and time-intensive lab evaluations.

***

## 🔹 Features

- Complete data preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, split routines
- Customizable **Deep Neural Network** (PyTorch) architecture
- Benchmarking with advanced **Gradient Boosting Machines** (XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Multi-metric evaluation:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - R² Score
    - A20 Index (within ±20% error)
- Insightful visualizations: learning curves, prediction scatters, feature importances

## 🔹 Model Performance Example

| Model    | R² Score | MAE (MPa) | A20 Index |
|----------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| DNN      | 0.84     |   2.8     |   0.82    |
| XGBoost  | 0.87     |   2.5     |   0.79    |
| CatBoost | 0.88     |   2.4     |   0.81    |

*Above metrics are from your code's own validation outputs.*

## 🔹 Insights

- **Concrete Age** and **Cement proportion** dominate in predictive importance.
- DNN models capture non-linear interactions within materials well.
- Feature importance from gradient boosting guides targeted mix improvements.
- **A20 Index** ensures predictions are realistic for field engineering use.
